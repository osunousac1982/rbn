## What Makes a Great Personal Statement?

Admissions officers read thousands of personal statements each year, and many of them begin to blur together. So, how do you make yours stand out? The key is authenticity. Your personal statement should offer insight into your character, motivations, and why you’re passionate about your field of study.

Here are a few tips to make your personal statement shine:

- **Start with a strong introduction** : Grab the reader’s attention from the first sentence. A compelling opening will make them want to read more.
- **Be specific** : Instead of generic statements, share personal experiences and stories that demonstrate your skills and aspirations.
- **Stay focused** : Don’t try to cover everything in your personal statement. Choose one or two key experiences or qualities that best represent you.
- **Show, don’t tell** : Instead of simply stating that you're passionate or hardworking, provide examples that illustrate these traits.
